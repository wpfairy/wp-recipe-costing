# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

A standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins.

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you're currently reading.

## Features

* Based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.

## Installation

Can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs.

## Important Notes

### Includes

Note that if you include your own classes, or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said files may go:

* `plugin-name/includes` is where functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts of the site reside
* `plugin-name/admin` is for all admin-specific functionality

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate was started in 2011 by [Tom McFarlin](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) and has since included a number of great contributions. In March of 2015 the project was handed over by Tom to Devin Vinson.

The current version of the Boilerplate was developed in conjunction with [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton), [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich), and [Brad Vincent](https://twitter.com/themergency).

The homepage is based on a design as provided by [HTML5Up](http://html5up.net), the Boilerplate logo was designed by Rob McCaskill of [BungaWeb](http://bungaweb.com), and the site `favicon` was created by [Mickey Kay](https://twitter.com/McGuive7).
